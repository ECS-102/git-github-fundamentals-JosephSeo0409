What I learned so far in GitHub is that it is a useful resource that is used by professionals in the industry.
It can be used to work on the code collabratively from long distances.
Different people can work on a part of the code and then commit their changes which would allow the other team members to see the changes.
It is important that different people don't change the same thing so that there is no problems when the code is committed and put together.

GitHub is an important tool that I have to master in order to become a trusted profressional in the industry due to its prevalence in the industry.
